# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to evaluate green stock options using the criteria of Total Daily Volume and rate of Return.  This project uses VBA and Excel to process data from 2017 and 2018 to arrive at these criteria.

## Results
The images below illustrate the volatility of the stock market.  In 2017, 11 out of the 12 stocks analysed had a profitable rate of return.  However, 2018 is essentially an inversion; only 2 out of the same 12 stocks had a profitable year.  Even given the significant gains many of these stocks earned in 2017, the substantial dive they take in 2018 should give the investor pause.  ENPH and RUN appear to be the most reliable, but taking a look at a larger set of data would be advised.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code
The advantages of refactoring code include creating more streamlined code that performs more quickly and efficiently.  The drawbacks may include adding an additional step before a final product is reached and the possiblity of introducing new errors in the process of revision.

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored code for this project
The primary advantage in refactoring this code was the enhanced performance.  In the original code, the 2017 and 2018 macros ran in .584 seconds and .757 respectively.  In the refactored code, the macros were executed in .078 seconds for 2017 and .113 for 2018.  The disadvantages are, again, additional time investment and the possiblity of introducing new errors.
